        This website template is designed to show the complexity of creative
        professionals in a clean and modern environment. Its black & white
        aesthetics and full-bleed images make this layout to feel less like a
        website and more like an online personal gallery. Like all our livebooks
        templates, this is easy to set up with your own content and has
        dedicated SEO fields for you to fill in and make your presence visible
        on any search engines.
